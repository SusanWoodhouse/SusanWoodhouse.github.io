## About Me

I am excited to fully immerse myself in the sandbox of new technologies and tools, despite having worked in administrative support roles and not as a developer for over 20 years. With my recent ADHD/VAST neurodivergence diagnosis, I believe I have a unique perspective to offer and am equipped with new tools to unleash my superpowers. I firmly believe that diversity is key to innovation, and I am eager to be a part of a team that values and embraces differences. By bringing together diverse perspectives and experiences, we can create truly innovative solutions that make a positive impact on the world. I am looking forward to celebrating our differences and working collaboratively to make magic happen. Let's achieve great things together in the tech industry!
